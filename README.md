# Unity-FPS-Sandbox

In this sandbox, I have created assets for a FPS game with several features I have learned from various tutorial on the internet (Brackeys on Youtube).

Right now the character :
- Can be controlled (move, sprint and jump) with mouse and keyboard.
- Shoot with differents weapons with different caracteristics.
- Switch between weapons.
- Reload when a weapon is empty.
- Launch grenades.
- Destroy crats whith weapons and grenandes.
- See how much ammos remains in the equipped weapon.
